# 1. Sum of All Elements in a List
**Logic:**  
- Go through each element in the list and keep adding it to a `total` variable.
- At the end, the `total` will be the sum of all the elements.


# 2. Check If a Number is Odd or Even
**Logic:**  
- Divide the number by 2.
- If the remainder is `0`, it’s even; otherwise, it’s odd.


# 3. Compute Factorial Using a Loop
**Logic:**  
- Multiply numbers from `1` to `n` in sequence.
- The result will be the factorial of the number.


# 4. Reverse a String Without Using Built-in Methods
**Logic:**  
- Start with an empty string.
- Add each character to the front of the new string.
- This reverses the string by the end of the loop.


# 5. Compute Factorial Using Recursion
**Logic:**  
- A function calls itself with a smaller input (`n-1`).
- Base case: return `1` if `n == 0` or `n == 1`.
- Multiply the current number by the result of the recursive call.


# 6. Sum of Digits of a Number
**Logic:**  
- Extract the last digit using `% 10`.
- Add it to the sum.
- Remove the last digit using `// 10`.
- Repeat until the number becomes `0`.
